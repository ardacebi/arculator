## Building
Because of used features, Arculator **needs** to be builded with C++11. Other versions will probably not work.

```
g++ -std=c++11 arculator.cpp -o arculator.out
```

```
./arculator.out
```

## Features
### Regular Calculation
Arculator (as being a calculator) features a classic calculator mode for your regular calculations that you can use with `+`, `-`, `/`, `*` and others.

### Conversion
Arculator also offers a conversion mode (inpired by Windows' built-in calculator) which has options like Volume, Length, Temperature, Currency (requires connectivity) and others. 


## Roadmap
- [ ] Complete all unit conversions.
- [ ] Add standard calculating ability.
- [ ] Submit to package managers such as Homebrew for easier usage and convert to a proper command line tool.
