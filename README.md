# ARCULATOR
The advanced terminal calculator and converter.

## Building
Because of used features, Arculator **needs** to be builded with C++11. Other versions will probably not work.

```
g++ -std=c++11 arculator.cpp -o arculator.out
```

```
./arculator.out
```

## Roadmap
- [ ] Complete all unit conversions.
- [ ] Add standard calculating ability.
- [ ] Submit to package managers such as Homebrew for easier usage.
